## How it works

The micro tiles test module is a simple module that demonstrates the use of the micro tile interface. It generates VGA output for displaying patterns. 

## How to test

This project will work out of the box. Just connect a VGA display via [TinyVGA PMOD](https://github.com/mole99/tiny-vga).
